      "     was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\n",

      "     who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal\n",
      "     party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is\n",
      "     said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had\n",
      "     caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or\n",

      "     disappearance of the bride.'\" It appears that she was formerly a danseuse\n",
      "     at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. \"Good-day, Lord St. Simon,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing. Lord St. Simon glanced over it. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\n",
      "     questioning you.\" \"You see, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"my wife was twenty before\n",
      "     her father became a rich man. On the other\n",
      "     hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to\n",
      "     bear\"--he gave a little stately cough--\"had not I thought her to be\n",
      "     at bottom a noble woman. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the\n",
      "     pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse\n",
      "     for the fall. \"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\n",
      "     frame of mind than she had gone to it. \"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\n",
      "     company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\n",
      "     already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning.\" Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned,\n",
      "     and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive\n",
      "     expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had\n",
      "     foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two\n",
      "     police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out\n",
      "     again. \"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. \"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will\n",
      "     not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\n",
      "     success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\" Lord St. Simon shook his head. \"I am afraid that it will take wiser\n",
      "     heads than yours or mine,\" he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\n",
      "     old-fashioned manner he departed. \"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on\n",
      "     a level with his own,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"I think that\n",
      "     I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this\n",
      "     cross-questioning. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years\n",
      "     back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year\n",
      "     after the Franco-Prussian War. asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \"And very wet it seems to have made you,\" said Holmes laying his hand\n",
      "     upon the arm of the pea-jacket. \"Oh, indeed! \"Oh, indeed!\" \"I am afraid that you will find it difficult.\" Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away\n",
      "     by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was\n",
      "     responsible for her disappearance. Good-day,\n",
      "     Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\n",
      "     first.\" It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\n",
      "     time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's\n",
      "     man with a very large flat box. asked Holmes. Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his\n",
      "     forehead. \"It was a slight, sir, a public slight,\" said Lord St. Simon, tapping\n",
      "     his fingers upon the table. \"I think that I heard a ring,\" said Holmes. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\n",
      "     matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be\n",
      "     more successful.\" \"Lord St. Simon,\" said he \"allow me to introduce you to\n",
      "     Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. \"Pray make no apology to me,\" said Lord St. Simon bitterly. \"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should\n",
      "     have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\n",
      "     the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't know what I was\n",
      "     doing or saying. \"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\n",
      "     room while you explain this matter?\" We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then\n",
      "     one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank\n",
      "     here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa\n",
      "     grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn't hear of our\n",
      "     engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank said\n",
      "     that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim\n",
      "     me until he had as much as pa. Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all\n",
      "     up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did\n",
      "     it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I\n",
      "     went back to pa.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he\n",
      "     went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. Then Lord St. Simon came to\n",
      "     'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa\n",
      "     was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth\n",
      "     would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor\n",
      "     Frank. \"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done my\n",
      "     duty by him. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had\n",
      "     escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead\n",
      "     and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at\n",
      "     last on the very morning of my second wedding.\" So Frank took my\n",
      "     wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I\n",
      "     should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one\n",
      "     could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris\n",
      "     to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to\n",
      "     us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and\n",
      "     he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank\n",
      "     was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we\n",
      "     were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to\n",
      "     Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at\n",
      "     once. Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\n",
      "     listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\n",
      "     narrative. \"I think that there you ask a little too much,\" responded his\n",
      "     Lordship. I think that\n",
      "     with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\" \"The case has been an interesting one,\" remarked Holmes when our\n",
      "     visitors had left us, \"because it serves to show very clearly how\n",
      "     simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\n",
      "     to be almost inexplicable. \"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\n",
      "     lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the\n",
      "     other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning\n",
      "     home. If she had, it\n",
      "     must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in\n",
      "     this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so\n",
      "     deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce\n",
      "     her to change her plans so completely. When he told us of a man in a pew,\n",
      "     of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for\n",
      "     obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\n",
      "     confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to\n",
      "     claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of\n",
      "     that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation\n",
      "     became absolutely clear. In the second one\n",
      "     which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection\n",
      "     of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left\n",
      "     only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I\n",
      "     came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His\n",
      "     letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I\n",
      "     travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at\n",
      "     home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out\n",
      "     to them that it would be better in every way that they should make\n",
      "     their position a little clearer both to the general public and to\n",
      "     Lord St. Simon in particular. \"Ah, Watson,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"perhaps you would not be very\n",
